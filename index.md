### CPSC 120

- Lab 3

In lab 3, part 1 was the lab that helped me understand how to declare a variable and print and include the user's variable in a sentence. All of these are the fundamental parts of coding and the start of my learning a new language This was my first time coding, and I was very proud of my work since I learned all this information from my resources.

- Lab 4

In lab 4, part 1 was different and difficult since I did not know how to include formulas in my programming. Learning how to write formulas in C++ was similar because it uses PEMDAS but different in the way the formula is formatted with the variable that I had to create. Even if this lab was hard but very rewarding to see that I can do this but defining what one formula is used for and then using variables for that specific equation. When I finished this lab, it helped me with my other labs because I know now how to use defined variables in the equations.

- Lab 12

In lab 12, part 2 incorporated all the skills that I learn from previous labs but added information about how to make images. This tested my abilities to see if I know how to use my bools functions, if-statements, initialization, and vector skills. This programming was challenging but very successful since it allowed me to fuse everything I learned to create a beautiful image.
